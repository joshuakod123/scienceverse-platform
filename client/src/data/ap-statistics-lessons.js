            <h3>The Science of Data</h3>
            <p>Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make decisions. It's a powerful tool that transforms raw information into meaningful insights.</p>
            
            <div class="definition-box">
              <h4>üìö Definition</h4>
              <p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why Statistics Matters</h3>
            <p>In our data-driven world, statistics helps us:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make informed decisions based on evidence</li>
              <li>Understand patterns and trends</li>
              <li>Evaluate claims and arguments</li>
              <li>Predict future outcomes</li>
              <li>Solve complex problems</li>

            <h3>The Heart of Statistics: Variation</h3>
            <p>Variation is everywhere! No two things are exactly alike, and this variation is what makes statistics necessary and powerful.</p>
            
            <div class="concept-highlight">
              <h4>üé≤ Key Concept: Variation</h4>
              <p>Variation refers to the differences we observe in data. It can be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural variation:</strong> Normal differences between individuals</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement variation:</strong> Differences due to measurement errors</li>
                <li><strong>Sampling variation:</strong> Differences between samples from the same population</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Sources of Variation</h3>
            <p>Consider measuring the height of students in your class:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Genetic factors create natural variation</li>
              <li>Measurement tools might have slight errors</li>
              <li>Time of day (people are slightly taller in the morning!)</li>
              <li>Posture and measurement technique</li>

            <h3>Numbers Without Context Are Meaningless</h3>
            <p>Consider this number: <strong>98.6</strong></p>
            <p>What does it mean? Without context, it's just a number. But when we add context:</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
              <h4>Context Changes Everything</h4>
              <ul>

                <li><strong>98.6%</strong> - An excellent test score</li>
                <li><strong>$98.60</strong> - The price of something</li>
                <li><strong>98.6 seconds</strong> - A time measurement</li>
